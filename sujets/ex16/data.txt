Don't underestimate the Force.
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Red Five standing by. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?
I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!
Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
